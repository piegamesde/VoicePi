VERSION 0.3.0
- Added MultiRecognizer and MultiSpeechEngine, allowing to combine multiple inputs and outputs
- Changed how context states work. Inter-module communication is possible now, but won't be exposed to the used through configuration
- Passive modules that monitor things in the background and notify you once something happens. There are none yet, but they are technically possible now

- Updated .gitignore

VERSION 0.2.0
- Added Actions. Use Actions to run commands, play sound or say text
- Added settings based on these actions
- Made TTS and STT configurable
- Split running commands from the RunCommandAction
- ActionModule has now context too which makes it a lot more powerful
- Two more tests. Fixed a _lot_ more bugs.
